_ptr[drum_notation]_


beg - a new programming language, based on the strategy of wishful-thinking as introduced by Ableson and Sussman in SICP.  Examples:
  beg('make it work')
  beg('write the spec for me') [see Dilbert]
  beg('get it all shippable')
  beg('make this whole misunderstanding wrt exponential vs linear variation work out in the end')
note that semicolons are optional in beg - how convenient is that not!?
